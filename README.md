# Rattle Programming Language

A simple language heavily inspired by python, from design to features. This is an experimental project on my ability to design and implement a full language that is maintainable and scalable. Sample source files can be found [here](./example/).  
`*.rat` extension has been chosen as the suffix of the language.
